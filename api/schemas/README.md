What Are Schemas?

In FastAPI (with Pydantic), schemas define the shape of data:

Request validation → what the frontend must send.
Response shaping → what the backend sends back.
Security → prevents overposting (user can’t send extra fields).
Docs → automatically show up in Swagger (/docs).

Link between frontend ↔ backend.
